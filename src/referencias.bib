abstract = {HyperText Markup Language (HTML) can be used to represent Hypertext news, mail, online documentation, and collaborative hypermedia; Menus of options; Database query results; Simple structured documents with inlined graphics. Hypertext views of existing bodies of information The World Wide Web (W3) initiative links related information throughout the globe. HTML provides one simple format for throughout the globe. HTML provides one simple format for providing linked information, and all W3 compatible programs are required to be capable of handling HTML. W3 uses an Internet protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP), which allows transfer representations to be negotiated between client and server, the result being returned in an extended MIME message. HTML is therefore just one, but an important one, of the representations used with W3. HTML is proposed as a MIME content type. HTML refers to the URL specification of RFCxxxx. Implementations of HTML parsers and generators can be found in the various W3 servers and browsers, in the public domain W3 code, and may also be built using various public domain SGML parsers such as [SGMLS] . HTML is an SGML document type with fairly generic semantics appropriate for representing information from a wide range of applications. It is more generic than many specific SGML applications, but is still completely device-independent.},

It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers . A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .},

Twitter is undoubtedly the king of the RTW. It boasts 100+ million users and generates in the region of 50m tweets per day. This RTW data is far from the structured data (ratings, product features, etc.) familiar to recommender systems research, but it is useful to consider its applicability to recommendation scenarios. In this short paper we describe an experiment to look at harnessing the real-time opinions of movie fans, expressed through the Twitter-like short textual reviews available on the Blippr service (www.blippr.com). In particular we describe how users and movies can be represented from the terms used in their associated reviews and describe a number of experiments to highlight the recommendation potential of this RTW data-source and approach.},

abstract = {If anything about current interaction design can be called " glamorous, " it's creating Web applications. After all, when was the last time you heard someone rave about the interaction design of a product that wasn't on the Web? (Okay, besides the iPod.) All the cool, innovative new projects are online. Despite this, Web interaction designers can't help but feel a little envious of our colleagues who create desktop software. Desktop applications have a richness and responsiveness that has seemed out of reach on the Web. The same simplicity that enabled the Web's rapid proliferation also creates a gap between the experiences we can provide and the experiences users can get from a desktop application. That gap is closing. Take a look at Google Suggest. Watch the way the suggested terms update as you type, almost instantly. Now look at Google Maps. Zoom in. Use your cursor to grab the map and scroll around a bit. Again, everything happens almost instantly, with no waiting for pages to reload.},

abstract = {This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol. RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of-service for real-time services. The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provideminimal control and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes. There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
