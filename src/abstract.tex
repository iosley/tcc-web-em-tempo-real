	\textbf{Abstract}:
	In a few years after its creation, the World Wide Web has gone from static and non-interactive pages to rich and complex applications. These changes were accompanied by improved execution environments and development technologies. As web applications became more dynamic, with a high amount of messages exchanged between clients and servers, it became necessary to use techniques to reduce latency and allow a more timely communication. This study aims to understand the limitations of the HTTP protocol for real-time communication on the web, to display palliative methods in the historical context and solutions currently used for web application development that require constant communication between client and server, through documentary research with use of theoretical materials that approach the theme and develop concepts, ideas and understandings, aiming to find solutions, and understand the positives and negatives of each solution. Demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of AJAX, the advantages of using the Server-Sent Event and WebSockets in modern browsers. Afirm that, because of the low latency and good acceptance of the modern browsers, WebSockets proves to be the best solution for two-way communication between a client and server, allowing communication over a single TCP socket operating on the same standard HTTP port
